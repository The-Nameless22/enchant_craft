Hello!

I love JurassicWorld123's Paper Minecraft (link below), but enchantments are a bit frustrating.
You can only find Enchanted Books in dungeon chests, so it's pretty hard to get the enchants you want.
Becuase I'm too stupid to add an Enchanting Table, I made recipes to craft the books.
Give me feedback for balancing changes I should make! Use the save code in the "world_Save.md" file to
see the recipes.

How to use the new recipes:
  1. Download the recipes.txt file.
  2. Click "show" on the "_Recipes.txt" list.
  3. Right click on the list.
  4. Click "Import" and select this file.
  5. The crafting recipes have now been added!

Version 1.0:
Added Power, Efficiency, Protection, Fortune, and Mending Book recipes.
