Hello!

I love JurassicWorld123's Paper Minecraft (link below), but enchantments are a bit frustrating.
You can only find Enchanted Books in dungeon chests, so it's pretty hard to get the enchants you want.
Becuase I'm too stupid to add an Enchanting Table, I made (in my opinion) fairly balanced recipes to 
craft the books.

How to use:

1. Download the file.
2. Click "show" on the "_Recipes.txt" list.
3. Right click on the list.
4. Click "Import" and select this file.
5. The crafting recipes have now been added!

Version 1.0:
Added Power, Efficiency, Protection, Fortune, and Mending Book recipes.
